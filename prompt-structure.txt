You are performing a LOCAL IMAGE EDIT using INPAINTING ONLY.

You are NOT generating a new image.
You are NOT re-imagining the room.
You are editing a FIXED background photograph.

The input image is a professionally photographed, EMPTY master bedroom.
The camera position, lens, perspective, vanishing points, and framing are LOCKED.

Any change to camera angle, zoom, crop, or perspective is a FAILURE.

---

TASK:
Realistically stage this EMPTY master bedroom by ADDING furniture and decor ONLY.

---

ABSOLUTE IMMUTABLE CONSTRAINTS — MUST NOT CHANGE:
- Camera angle, camera height, lens perspective, focal length, or field of view
- Image framing, crop, resolution, or aspect ratio
- Vanishing points or vertical/horizontal line alignment
- Walls, wall color, wall texture, or wall condition
- Flooring, carpet, floor material, or floor color
- Ceiling shape, height, color, or texture
- Windows, doors, trim, baseboards, vents, or architectural features
- Existing lighting direction, brightness, color temperature, or shadow behavior

DO NOT remove, resize, repaint, reposition, reinterpret, or regenerate any existing pixels outside the edited areas.

---

EDITING SCOPE (CRITICAL):
Only modify pixels where new furniture or decor is placed.
All unedited areas must remain pixel-identical to the original photo.

If furniture cannot be added without altering perspective or geometry, DO NOT ADD IT.

---

STYLE REQUIREMENTS:
Stage the room in a traditional, neutral, market-friendly real estate style.

Avoid trendy, bold, modern, or distracting decor.
The result should appeal to the broadest range of home buyers.

---

ONLY ADD THE FOLLOWING:
- A bed appropriate for a master bedroom, scaled realistically to the room
- Two matching nightstands placed symmetrically beside the bed
- Soft bedding, pillows, and neutral textiles
- An area rug placed ON TOP of the existing flooring
- Wall art or a mirror hung naturally on existing walls
- Subtle decorative accessories (minimal and restrained)
- Indoor plants (optional, realistic placement)
- Lamps that complement the existing lighting
- Curtains or blinds installed ONLY on existing windows

DO NOT add people, pets, electronics, clutter, or personal items.

---

ROOM LOGIC & SPACING:
- Furniture layout must reflect how a real master bedroom is used
- Maintain clear walkways and functional spacing
- Do not block doors, windows, vents, or architectural features
- Ensure balanced spacing around the bed with access to both sides
- Preserve negative space; do not overcrowd the room

---

REALISM REQUIREMENTS:
- All added objects must be photorealistic and indistinguishable from the original photograph
- Materials, textures, reflections, and shadows must match the existing lighting exactly
- Shadows must fall in the same direction and intensity as the original image
- No floating objects, warped geometry, or perspective distortion
- No illustrated, stylized, or CGI appearance

---

FAIL THE TASK IF ANY OF THE FOLLOWING OCCUR:
- Camera angle, zoom, or framing changes
- Room appears wider, narrower, taller, or shorter
- Vertical or horizontal lines shift or bend
- Ceiling height or wall angles appear altered
- Windows or doors move or resize
- The image looks regenerated instead of edited

---

FINAL OUTPUT RULE:
The final image must be IDENTICAL to the input photo in every way
EXCEPT for the addition of realistic furniture and decor.

Perform a professional real estate virtual staging edit that looks naturally photographed and MLS-ready.
